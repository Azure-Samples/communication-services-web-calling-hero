[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure-Samples%2Fcommunication-services-web-calling-hero%2Fmain%2Fdeploy%2Fazuredeploy.json)

# Group Calling Sample

This is a sample application to show how the Azure Communication Services Calling Web SDK can be used to build a group calling experience.
The client-side application is a React based user interface which uses Redux for handling complex state while leveraging Microsoft Fluent UI.
Powering this front-end is a C# web application powered by ASP.NET Core to connect this application with Azure Communication Services.

A separate branch with Teams Interop capabilities is [available](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-web-calling-hero/blob/teams-interop/README.md). Teams Interop is in public preview and uses beta SDKs that are not meant for production use. Please use the main branch sample for any production scenarios.

Additional documentation for this sample can be found on [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/samples/calling-hero-sample).

## Prerequisites

- Create an Azure account with an active subscription. For details, see [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F)
- [Node.js (12.18.4 and above)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Visual Studio (2019 and above)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
- [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1) (Make sure to install version that corresponds with your visual studio instance, 32 vs 64 bit)
- Create an Azure Communication Services resource. For details, see [Create an Azure Communication Resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource). You'll need to record your resource **connection string** for this quickstart.

## Code structure

- ./Calling/ClientApp: frontend client
	- ./Calling/ClientApp/src
		- ./Calling/ClientApp/src/Components : React components to help build the client app calling experience
		- ./Calling/ClientApp/src/Containers : Connects the redux functionality to the React components
		- ./Calling/ClientApp/src/Core : Containers a redux wrapper around the Azure Communication Services Web Calling SDK
	- ./ClientApp/src/index.js : Entry point for the client app
- ./Calling/Controllers : Server app core logic for client app to get a token to use with the Azure Communication Services Web Calling SDK
- ./Calling/Program.cs : Entry point for the server app program logic
- ./Calling/Startup.cs : Entry point for the server app startup logic

## Before running the sample for the first time
1. Open an instance of PowerShell, Windows Terminal, Command Prompt or equivalent and navigate to the directory that you'd like to clone the sample to.
2. `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/communication-services-web-calling-hero.git`
3. Get the `Connection String` from the Azure portal. For more information on connection strings, see [Create an Azure Communication Resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource)
4. Once you get the `Connection String`, add the connection string to the **Calling/appsetting.json** file found under the Calling folder. Input your connection string in the variable: `ResourceConnectionString`.

## Locally deploying the sample app

1. Go to Calling folder and open `Calling.csproj` solution in Visual Studio
2. Run `Calling` project. The browser will open at localhost:5001

### Troubleshooting

1. Solution doesn\'t build, it throws errors during NPM installation/build

	Clean/rebuild the C# solution

2. The app shows an "Unsupported browser" screen but I am on a [supported browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features#calling-client-library-browser-support).

	If your app is being served over a hostname other then localhost, you must serve traffic over https and not http.

## Publish to Azure

1. Right click the `Calling` project and select Publish.
2. Create a new publish profile and select your app name, Azure subscription, resource group and etc.
3. Before publish, add your connection string with `Edit App Service Settings`, and fill in `ResourceConnectionString` as key and connection string (copy from appsettings.json) as value

**Note**: While you may use http://localhost for local testing, the sample when deployed will only work when served over https. The SDK [does not support http](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/concepts/voice-video-calling/calling-sdk-features#user-webrtc-over-https).

## Building off of the sample

If you would like to build off of this sample to add calling capabilities to your own awesome application, keep a few things in mind:

- The sample serves a Single Page Application. This has a few implications.
  - By default, the served app cannot be embedded in another frame (e.g. as a web widget). See ./Calling/Startup.cs for details on how to enable embedding.
  - By default, the backend disables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). If you'd like to serve the backend APIs from a different domain than the static content, you must enable (restricted) CORS. This can be done by configuring a middleware in the backend in ./Calling/Startup.cs, or by configuring your server framework to modify HTTP response headers.
